<i>Of Brute and his descent, how he slue his father in hunting, his banishment, his letter to
king Pandrasus, against whom he wageth battell, taketh him prisoner, and concludeth
peace vpon conditions.</i></p>


<h3>THE FIRST CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
Hitherto haue we spoken of the inhabitants of this Ile before the comming of
Brute, although some will néeds haue it, that he was the first which inhabited the
same with his people descended of the Troians, some few giants onelie excepted whom he
vtterlie destroied, and left not one of them aliue through the whole Ile. But as we shall
not doubt of Brutes comming hither, so may we assuredly thinke, that he found the Ile
peopled either with the generation of those which Albion the giant had placed here, or
some other kind of people whom he did subdue, and so reigned as well ouer them as ouer
those which he brought with him.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
<i>Humfr. Lhoyd</i>.</span>
This Brutus, or Brytus [for this letter (Y) hath of ancient time had the sounds both of
V and I] (as the author of the booke which Geffrey of Monmouth translated dooth affirme)
was the sonne of Siluius, the sonne of Ascanius, the sonne of Aeneas the Troian, begotten
of his wife Creusa, &amp; borne in Troie, before the citie was destroied. But as other doo take
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Harding. Alex. Neuil. W. Har.</i></span>
it, the author of that booke (whatsoeuer he was) and such other as follow him, are deceiued
onelie in this point, mistaking the matter, in that Posthumus the sonne of Aeneas
(begotten of his wife Lauinia, and borne after his fathers deceasse in Italie) was called
Ascanius, who had issue a sonne named Iulius, who (as these other doo coniecture) was the
father of Brute, that noble chieftaine and aduenturous leader of those people, which being
descended (for the more part in the fourth generation) from those Troians that escaped
with life, when that roiall citie was destroied by the Gréekes, got possession of this woorthie
and most famous Ile.</p>
<p>
To this opinion Giouan Villani a Florentine in his vniuersall historie, speaking of Aeneas
and his ofspring kings in Italie, séemeth to agrée, where he saith: "Siluius (the sonne of
Aeneas by his wife Lauinia) fell in loue with a néece of his mother Lauinia, and by hir had
a sonne, of whom she died in trauell, and therefore was called Brutus, who after as he
grew in some stature, and hunting in a forrest slue his father vnwares, and therevpon for
feare of his grandfather Siluius Posthumus he fled the countrie, and with a retinue of such
as followed him, passing through diuers seas, at length he arriued in the Ile of Britaine."</p>
<p>
Concerning therefore our Brute, whether his father Iulius was sonne to Ascanius the sonne
of Aeneas by his wife Creusa, or sonne to Posthumus called also Ascanius, and sonne to
Aeneas by his wife Lauinia, we will not further stand. But this, we find, that when he
came to the age of 15. yéeres, so that he was now able to ride abrode with his father into
the forrests and chases, he fortuned (either by mishap, or by Gods prouidence) to strike his
<span class="rightnote">
Brute killeth his father.</span>
father with an arrow, in shooting at a déere, of which wound he also died. His grandfather<a name="page438" id="page438"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;438]</span>
(whether the same was Posthumus, or his elder brother) hearing of this great misfortune
that had chanced to his sonne Siluius, liued not long after, but died for verie greefe
and sorow (as is supposed) which he conceiued thereof. And the young gentleman, immediatlie
after he had slaine his father (in maner before alledged) was banished his countrie,
and therevpon got him into Grecia, where trauelling the countrie, he lighted by chance
among some of the Troian ofspring, and associating himselfe with them, grew by meanes
of the linage (whereof he was descended) in proces of time into great reputation among
them: chieflie by reason there were yet diuers of the Troian race, and that of great authoritie
<span class="rightnote">
Pausanias.</span>
in that countrie. For Pyrrhus the sonne of Achilles, hauing no issue by his wife
Hermione, maried Andromache, late wife vnto Hector: and by hir had thrée sonnes, Molossus,
Pileus, and Pergamus, who in their time grew to be of great power in those places
and countries, and their ofspring likewise: whereby Brutus or Brytus wanted no friendship.
For euen at his first comming thither, diuers of the Troians that remained in seruitude, being
desirous of libertie, by flocks resorted vnto him. And amongst other, Assaracus was one,
whom Brute intertained, receiuing at his hands the possession of sundrie forts and places
of defense, before that the king of those parties could haue vnderstanding or knowledge of
any such thing. Herewith also such as were readie to make the adueature with him, repaired
to him on ech side, wherevpon he first placed garisons in those townes which had
bene thus deliuered vnto him, and afterwards with Assaracus and the residue of the multitude
he withdrew into the mountains néere adioining. And thus being made strong with
such assistance, by consultation had with them that were of most authoritie about him,
wrote vnto the king of that countrie called Pandrasus, in forme as followeth.</p>
<p class="center">
<i>A letter of Brute to Pandrasus, as I find it set downe in Galfride Monumetensis.</i></p>
<p>
"Brute leader of the remnant of the Troian people, to Pandrasus king of the Greekes,
sendeth greeting. Bicause it hath beene thought a thing vnworthie, that the people descended
of the noble linage of Dardanus should be otherwise dealt with than the honour of
their nobilitie dooth require: they haue withdrawne themselues within the close couert of
the woods. For they haue chosen rather (after the maner of wild beasts) to liue on flesh
and herbs in libertie, than furnished with all the riches in the world to continue vnder the
yoke of seruile thraldome. But if this their dooing offend thy mightie highnesse, they are
not to be blamed, but rather in this behalfe to be pardoned, sith euerie captiue prisoner is
desirous to be restored vnto his former estate and dignitie. You therefore pitieng their case,
vouchsafe to grant them their abridged libertie, and suffer them to remaine in quiet within
these woods which they haue got into their possession: if not so, yet giue them licence to
depart forth of this countrie into some other parts."</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">
Pandrasus prepareth an armie to supress the Troian ofspring.</span>
The sight of these letters, and request in them conteined, made Pandrasus at the first
somewhat amazed, howbeit deliberating further of the matter, and considering their small
number, he made no great account of them, but determined out of hand to suppresse them
by force, before they should grow to a greater multitude. And to bring his intention the
<span class="leftnote">
Sparatinum.</span>
better to passe, he passed by a towne called Sparatinum, &amp; marching toward the woods
where he thoght to haue found his enimies, he was suddenlie assalted by Brute, who with
three thousand men came foorth of the woods, and fiercelie setting vpon his enimies, made
great slaughter of them, so that they were vtterlie discomfited, &amp; sought by flight to saue
<span class="rightnote">
Peraduenture Achelous.</span>
themselues in passing a riuer néere hand called Akalon. Brute with his men following
fast upon the aduersaries, caused them to plunge into the water at aduenture, so that manie
<span class="leftnote">
Antigonus, the brother of Pandrasus.</span>
of them were drowned. Howbeit Antigonus the brother of Pandrasus did what he could
to stay the Grecians from fléeing, and calling them backe againe did get some of them togither,
placed them in order, and began a new field: but it nothing auailed, for the Troians, preasing
vpon him, tooke him prisoner, slue and scattred his companie, and ceased not till they<a name="page439" id="page439"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;439]</span>
had rid the fields of all their aduersaries.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
Brute entreth into Sparatinum.</span>
This doone, Brute entering the towne, furnished it with six hundred able souldiours,
and afterwards went backe to the residue of his people that were incamped in the woods,
where he was receiued with vnspeakeable ioy for this prosperous atchiued enterprise. But
although this euill successe at the first beginning sore troubled Pandrasus, as well for the
losse of the field, as for the taking of his brother, yet was he rather kindled in desire to
séeke reuenge, than otherwise discouraged. And therefore assembling his people againe
togither that were scattered here and there, he came the next day before the towne of
Sparatinum, where he thought to haue found Brute inclosed togither with the prisoners,
and therfore he shewed his whole endeuour by hard siege and fierce assaults to force them
within to yeeld.</p>
<p>
To conclude, so long he continued the siege, till victuals began to waxe scant within,
so that there was no way but to yeeld, if present succour came not to remoue the siege:
wherevpon they signified their necessitie vnto Brute, who for that he had not power sufficient
to fight with the enimies in open field, he ment to giue them a camisado in the
night season, and so ordered his businesse, that inforsing a prisoner (named Anacletus
whome he had taken in the last battell) to serue his turne, by constreining him to take an
oth (which he durst not for conscience sake breake) he found means to encounter with
his enimies vpon the aduantage, that he did not onelie ouerthrowe their whole power, but
<span class="rightnote">
Panrdrasus taken prisoner.</span>
also tooke Pandrasus prisoner, whereby all the trouble was ended: and shortlie after a perfect
peace concluded, vpon these conditions following.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
The conditions of the agréement betwixt Brute &amp; Pandrasus.</span>
First, that Pandrasus should giue his daughter Innogen vnto Brute in mariage, with a
competent summe of gold and siluer for hir dowrie.</p>
<p>
Secondlie, to furnish him and his people with a nauie of ships, and to store the same with
victuals and all other necessaries.</p>
<p>
Thirdlie, that Brute with his people should haue licence to depart the countrie, to séeke
aduentures whither so euer it should please them to direct their course, without let, impeachment,
or trouble to be offered anie waies by the Gréeks.</p>
<p>
To all these conditions (bicause they touched not the prerogatiue of his kingdome) Pandrasus
did willinglie agrée, and likewise performed.</p>

<i>Brute and his wife Innogen arriue in Leogitia, they aske counsell of an oracle where they

downe of the Pyrenine hills into the sea.</i></p>


<h3>THE SECOND CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
Al things being thus brought to passe according to Brutes desire, wind also and wether
seruing the purpose, he with his wife Innogen and his people imbarked, and hoising vp
sailes departed from the coasts of Grecia. Now after two daies and a nights sailing, they
arriued at Leogitia (in some old written bookes of the British historie noted downe Lergetia)
an Iland, where they consulted with an oracle. Brute himselfe knéeling before the
idoll, and holding in his right hand a boll prepared for sacrifice full of wine, and the bloud
of a white hinde, spake in this maner as here followeth:</p>

<p class="indent">
Diua potens nemorum, terror syluestribus apris,<br />
<span class="indent2">Cui licet anfractus ire per æthereos,</span><br />
Infernasq; domos, terrestria iura resolue,<br />
<span class="indent2">Et die quas terras nos habitare velis:</span><br />
Dic certam sedem qua te venerabor in æuum,<br />
<span class="indent2">Qua tibi virgineis templa dicabo choris.</span><br />
</p>
<p><a name="page440" id="page440"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;440]</span>
These verses (as Ponticus Virumnius and others also doo gesse) were written by Gildas
Cambrius in his booke intituled <i>Cambreidos,</i> and may thus be Englished:</p>
<p class="indentq">
Thou goddesse that doost rule<br />
<span class="indent2">the woods and forrests greene,</span><br />
And chasest foming boares<br />
<span class="indent2">that flee thine awfull sight,</span><br />
Thou that maist passe aloft<br />
<span class="indent2">in airie skies so sheene,</span><br />
And walke eke vnder earth<br />
<span class="indent2">in places void of light,</span><br />

And shew where we shall dwell,<br />
<span class="indent2">according to thy will,</span><br />
In seates of sure abode,<br />
<span class="indent2">where temples we may dight</span><br />
For virgins that shall sound<br />
<span class="indent2">thy laud with voices shrill.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
After this praier and ceremonie done, according to the pagane rite and custome, Brute
abiding his answer, fell asléepe: in which sléepe appeared to him the said goddesse vttering
this answer in the verses following expressed.</p>
<p class="indent">
Brute, sub occasum solis trans Gallica regna,<br />
<span class="indent2">Insula in oceano est, vndiq; clausa mari,</span><br />
Insula in oceano est, habitata gigantibus olim,<br />

<p class="indentq">

An Ile which with the ocean seas<br />

Where giants dwelt sometime,<br />

<span class="indent2">the world shall whole subdew.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
After he awaked out of sléepe, and had called his dreame to remembrance, he first doubted
whether it were a verie dreame, or a true vision, the goddes hauing spoken to him with liuelie
voice. Wherevpon calling such of his companie vnto him as he thought requisite in such
a case, he declared vnto them the whole matter with the circumstances, whereat they greatlie
reioising, caused mightie bonfires to be made, in the which they cast wine, milke, and other
liquors, with diuers gums and spices of most sweet smell and sauour, as in the pagan religion<a name="page441" id="page441"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;441]</span>
was accustomed. Which obseruances and ceremonies performed and brought to end, they
returned streightwaies to their ships, and as soone as the wind served, passed forward on their
iournie with great ioy and gladnesse, as men put in comfort to find out the wished seats for
<span class="rightnote">
Brute with his companie landed in Affrike.</span>
their firme and sure habitations. From hence therefore they cast about, and making westward,
first arrived in Affrica, and after kéeping on their course, they passed the straits of
Gibralterra, and coasting alongst the shore on the right hand, they found another companie

The mistaking of those that haue copied the British historie putting
<i>Mare Tyrrhenum</i>, for <i>Pyrenæum</i></span>
that were likewise descended of the Troian progenie, on the coasts nere where the Pyrenine
hils shoot downe to the sea, whereof the same sea by good reason (as some suppose) was
named in those daies Mare Pyrenæum, although hitherto by fault of writers &amp; copiers of
the British historie receiued, in this place Mare Tyrrhenum, was slightlie put downe in stead of Pyrenæum.</p>
<p>
The ofspring of those Troians, with whom Brute and his companie thus did méet, were a
remnant of them that came away with Antenor. Their capteine hight Corineus, a man of
great modestie and approoued wisedome, and thereto of incomparable strength and boldnesse.</p>

<h3>THE THIRD CHAPTER.</h3>

<p><span class="rightnote">
Brute and Corineus ioin their companies together.</span>
After that Brute and the said Troians, by conference interchangeablie had, vnderstood
one anothers estates, and how they were descended from one countrie and progenie, they
vnited themselves togither, greatlie reioising that they were so fortunatlie met: and hoising
<span class="leftnote">
They arrive on the coasts of Gallia, now called France.</span>
vp their sailes, directed their course forward still, till they arriued within the mouth of the
riuer of Loire, which diuideth Aquitaine from Gall Celtike, where they tooke land within
the dominion of a king called Goffarius, surnamed Pictus, by reason he was descended of

the people Agathyrsi, otherwise named Picts, bicause they used to paint their faces and

bicause they did weare much
gold about them. They vsed their wives in common, and bicause they are all supposed to
be brethren, there is no strife nor discord among them. Of these Agathyrsi, it is recorded

The countrie of Poictou (as some hold) where the said Goffarius reigned, tooke name of
this people: &amp; likewise a part of this our Ile of Britaine now conteined within Scotland,
<span class="rightnote">
Pightland or Pictland.</span><a name="page442" id="page442"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;442]</span>
which in ancient time was called Pightland or Pictland, as elsewhere both in this historie of
England, and also of Scotland may further appeare. But to our purpose.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
Goffarius sendeth vnto Brute.</span>
When Goffarius the king of Poictou was aduertised of the landing of these strangers
within his countrie, he sent first certeine of his people to vnderstand what they ment by their
comming a land within his dominion, without licence or leaue of him obteined. They that
were thus sent, came by chance to a place where Corineus with two hundred of the
companie were come from the ships into a forrest néere the sea side, to kill some veneson for
<span class="leftnote">
Corineus answereth the messengers. Imbert.</span>
their sustenance: and being rebuked with some disdainfull speach of those Poictouins, he
shaped them a round answer: insomuch that one of them whose name was Imbert, let driue
an arrow at Corineus: but he auoiding the danger thereof, shot againe at Imbert, in reuenge
<span class="rightnote">
Imbert is slaine by Corineus.</span>
of that iniurie offered, and claue his head in sunder. The rest of the Poictouins fled therevpon,
and brought word to Goffarius what had happened: who immediatlie with a mightie
<span class="lefnote">
Goffarius raiseth an armie.</span>
armie made forward to encounter with the Troians, and comming to ioine with them in battell,

after a sharpe and sore conflict, in the end Brute with his armie obteined a triumphant victorie,
speciallie through the noble prowesse of Corineus.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
Goffarius séeketh aid against Brute.</span>
Goffarius escaping from the field, fled into the inner parts of Gallia, making sute for
assistance vnto such kings as in those daies reigned in diuers prouinces of that land, who
promised to aid him with all their forces, and to expell out of the coasts of Aquitaine, such
strangers as without his licence were thus entred the countrie. But Brute in the meane time
<span class="leftnote">
Brute spoileth the countrie.</span>
passed forward, and with fire and sword made hauocke in places where he came: and gathering
great spoiles, fraught his ships with plentie of riches. At length he came to the place,
<span class="rightnote">
Turonium or Tours built by Brute.</span>
where afterwards he built a citie named Turonium, that is, Tours.</p>
<p><span class="leftnote">
Goffarius hauiag renewed his forces, fighteth eftsoones with Brute.</span>
Here Goffarius with such Galles as were assembled to his aid, gaue battell againe vnto the
Troians that were incamped to abide his comming. Where after they had fought a long
time with singular manhood on both parties: the Troians in fine oppressed with multitudes
of aduersaries (euen thirtie times as manie mo as the Troians) were constreined to retire into
their campe, within the which the Galles kept them as besieged, lodging round about them,
and purposing by famine to compell them to yéeld themselues vnto their mercie. But Corineus
taking counsell with Brute, deuised to depart in the darke of the night out of the campe, to
lodge himselfe with thrée thousand chosen souldiers secretlie in a wood, and there to remaine
in couert till the morning that Brute should come foorth and giue a charge vpon the enimies,
wherewith Corineus should breake foorth and assaile the Galles on the backes.</p>
<p>
This policie was put in practise, and tooke such effect as the deuisers themselues wished:
for the Galles being sharplie assailed on the front by Brute and his companie, were now with
the sudden comming of Corineus (who set vpon them behind on their backes) brought into
such a feare, that incontinentlie they tooke them to flight, whom the Troians egerlie pursued,
making no small slaughter of them as they did ouertake them. In this battell Brute
lost manie of his men, and amongst other one of his nephues named Turinus, after he had
shewed maruellous proofe of his manhood. Of him (as some haue written) the foresaid
citie of Tours tooke the name, and was called <i>Turonium</i>, bicause the said Turinus was
there buried.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Theuet</i>.</span>

sauiour 197.</p>
<p>
But to our matter concerning Brute, who after he had obteined so famous a victorie, albeit
there was good cause for him to reioise, yet it sore troubled him to consider that his numbers
dailie decaied, and his enimies still increased, and grew stronger: wherevpon resting doubtfull
<span class="rightnote">

what to doo, whether to procéed against the Galles, or returne to his ships to séeke the
Ile that was appointed him by oracle, at length he chose the surest and best way, as he tooke
it, and as it proued. For whilest the greater part of his armie was yet left aliue, and that
the victorie remained on his side, he drew to his nauie, and lading his ships with excéeding
great store of riches which his people had got abroad in the countrie, he tooke the seas againe.<a name="page443" id="page443"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;443]</span>

<h3>THE FOURTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
When Brute had entred this land, immediatlie after his arriuall (as writers doo record)
he searched the countrie from side to side, and from end to end, finding it in most places
verie fertile and plentious of wood and grasse, and full of pleasant springs and faire riuers.
<span class="rightnote">
Brute encountered by the giants.</span>
As he thus trauelled to discouer the state and commodities of the Iland, he was encountred
by diuers strong and mightie giants, whome he destroied and slue, or rather subdued, with
all such other people as he found in the Iland, which were more in number than by report
of some authors it should appeare there were. Among these giants (as Geffrey of Monmouth
writeth) there was one of passing strength and great estimation, named Gogmagog,
<span class="rightnote">
Cornieus wrestleth with Gogmagog.</span>
whome Brute caused Corineus to wrestle at a place beside Douer, where it chanced that
the giant brake a rib in the side of Corineus while they stroue to claspe, and the one to ouerthrow
the other: wherewith Corineus being sore chafed and stirred to wrath, did so double
his force that he got the vpper hand of the giant, and cast him downe headlong from one of
<span class="leftnote">
Gogmagog is slaine.</span>
the rocks there, not farre from Douer, and so dispatched him: by reason whereof the place
was named long after, <i>The fall or leape of Gogmagog</i>, but afterward it was called <i>The fall
of Douer.</i> For this valiant déed, and other the like seruices first and last atchiued, Brute
<span class="rightnote">
Cornwall giuen to Cornineus.</span>
gaue vnto Corineus the whole countrie of Cornwall. To be briefe, after that Brute had
destroied such as stood against him, and brought such people vnder his subiection as he found
in the Ile, and searched the land from the one end to the other: he was desirous to build
a citie, that the same might be the seate roiall of his empire or kingdome. Wherevpon he
chose a plot of ground lieng on the north side of the riuer of Thames, which by good consideration
séemed to be most pleasant and conuenient for any great multitude of inhabitants,
aswell for holsomnesse of aire, goodnesse of soile, plentie of woods, and commoditie of the
riuer, seruing as well to bring in as to carrie out all kinds of merchandize and things necessarie
for the gaine, store, and vse of them that there should inhabit.</p>
<p>
Here therefore he began to build and lay the foundation of a citie, in the tenth or (as
other thinke) in the second yeare after his arriuall, which he named (saith Gal. Mon.)
Troinouant, or (as Hum. Llhoyd saith) Troinewith, that is, new Troy, in remembrance of that
noble citie of Troy from whence he and his people were for the greater part descended.</p>
<p>
When Brutus had builded this citie, and brought the Iland fullie vnder his subiection, he
by the aduise of his nobles commanded this Ile (which before hight Albion) to be called
Britaine, and the inhabitants Britons after his name, for a perpetuall memorie that he was the
first bringer of them into the land. In this meane while also he had by his wife. iii. sonnes,
the first named Locrinus or Locrine, the second Cambris or Camber, and the third Albanactus
or Albanact. Now when the time of his death drew néere, to the first he betooke the
gouernment of that part of the land nowe knowne by the name of England: so that the
same was long after called Loegria, or Logiers, of the said Locrinus. To the second he
appointed the countrie of Wales, which of him was first named Cambria, diuided from<a name="page444" id="page444"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;444]</span>
Loegria by the riuer of Seuerne. To his third sonne Albanact he deliuered all the north
part of the Ile, afterward called Albania, after the name of the said Albanact: which portion
of the said He lieth beyond the Humber northward. Thus when Brutus had diuided
<span class="rightnote">
In the daies of this our Brute Saule and Samuell gouerned Israell.</span>
the Ile of Britaine (as before is mentioned) into 3. parts, and had gouerned the same by the
space of 15. yeares, he died in the 24 yeare after his arriuall (as Harison noteth) and was
buried at Troinouant or London: although the place of his said buriall there be now

<h3>THE FIFT CHAPTER.</h3>
<p><span class="rightnote">
LOCRINE THE SECOND RULER OF BRITAIN. <i>Gal. Mon. Mat. West. Fa. out of G. de Co.
Gal Mon. Mat. West.</i></span>
Locrinus or Locrine the first begotten sonne of Brute began to reigne ouer the
countrie called Logiers, in the yeare of the world 1874, and held to his part the countrie
that reached from the south sea vnto the riuer of Humber. While this Locrinus gouerned
Logiers, his brother Albanact ruled in Albania, where in fine he was slaine in a battell by a
king of the Hunnes or Scythians, called Humber, who inuaded that part of Britaine, and
got possession thereof, till Locrinus with his brother Camber, in reuenge of their other
brothers death, and for the recouerie of the kingdome, gathered their powers togither, and
comming against the said king of the Hunnes, by the valiancie of their people they discomfited
<span class="leftnote">
It should seéme that he was come over the Humber. <i>Gal. Mon.</i></span>
him in battell, and chased him so egerlie, that he himselfe and a great number of his
men were drowned in the gulfe that then parted Loegria and Albania, which after tooke name
of the said king, and was called Humber, and so continueth vnto this daie.</p>

<p>
Moreouer in this battell against the Hunnes were thrée yong damsels taken of excellent
beautie, specially one of them, whose name was Estrild, daughter to a certeine king of
Scythia. With this Estrild king Locrine fell so farre in loue, notwithstanding a former contract
made betwixt him and the ladie Guendoloena, daughter to Corineus duke of Cornwall,
that he meant yet with all spéed to marie the same Estrild. But being earnestlie called vpon,
and in manner forced thereto by Corineus, hée changed his purpose, and married Guendoloena,
kéeping neuertheles the aforesaid Estrild as paramour still after a secret sort, during
the life of Corineus his father in law.</p>
<p>
Now after that Corineus was departed this world, Locrine forsooke Guendoloena, and
maried Estrild. Guendoloena therefore being cast off by hir husband, got hir into Cornewall
to hir friends and kinred, and there procured them to make warre against the said Locrine
hir husband, in the which warres hée was slaine, and a battell fought néere to the riuer of
<span class="rightnote">
<i> Mat. West.</i></span>
Sture, after he had reigned (as writers affirme) twentie yeares, &amp; was buried by his father in
the citie of Troinouant, leauing behind him a yoong sonne (begotten of his wife Guendoloena)
named Madan, as yet vnméete to gouerne.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
Shée is not numbred amongst those that reigned as rulers in this land by <i>Mat. West.</i></span>
Guendoloena or Guendoline the wife of Locrinus, and daughter of Corineus duke of
Cornewall, for so much as hir sonne Madan was not of yeeres sufficient to gouerne, was by
common consent of the Britons made ruler of the Ile, in the yéere of the world 2894, and
so hauing the administration in hir hands, she did right discreetlie vse hir selfe therein, to
the comfort of all hir subiects, till hir sonne Madan came to lawfull age, and then she gaue
ouer the rule and dominion to him, after she had gouerned by the
<span class="leftnote">
<i>Gal. Mon.</i></span>
space of fifteene yeares.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
MADAN THE THIRD RULER</span>
Madan the sonne of Locrine and Guendoline entred into the gouernement of Britaine in
the 2909, of the world. There is little left in writing of his doings, sauing that he vsed
great tyrannie amongst his Britons: and therefore after he had ruled this land the tearme of
40. yeares, he was deuoured of wild beastes, as he was abroad in hunting. He left behind<a name="page445" id="page445"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;445]</span>
him two sonnes, Mempricius and Manlius. He builded (as is reported) Madancaistre, now
Dancastre, which reteineth still the later part of his name.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
MEMPRICIUS THE FOURTH RULER. <i>Fabian.</i> Manlius is slaine.

Mempricius the eldest sonne of Madan began his reigne ouer the Britons in the yeare of
the world 2949, he continued not long in peace. For his brother Manlius vpon an ambitious
mind prouoked the Britons to rebell against him, so that sore and deadly warre continued
long betweene them. But finallie, vnder colour of a treatie, Manlius was slaine by
his brother Mempricius, so that then he liued in more tranquillitie and rest. Howbeit, being
deliuered thus from trouble of warres, he fell into slouth, and so into vnlawfull lust of
lecherie, and thereby into the hatred of his people, by forcing of their wiues and daughters:
and finallie became so beastlie, that he forsooke his lawfull wife and all his concubines, and
fell into the abhominable sinne of Sodomie. And thus from one vice he fell into another, till
<span class="rightnote">
Mempricius is deuoured of beastes.</span>
he became odious to God and man, and at length, going on hunting, was lost of his people,
and destroied of wild beastes, when he had reigned twentie yeares, leauing behind him a
noble yoong sonne named Ebranke, begotten of his lawfull wife.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
EBRANKE THE FIFT RULER. Ebranke had 21. wiues: his thirtie daughters sent
into Italie. <i>Bergomas lib. 6.</i></span>
Ebranke the sonne of Mempricius began to rule ouer the Britons in the yeare of the
world 2969. He had as writers doo of him record, one and twentie wiues, on whom he
begot 20. sonnes and 30. daughters, of the which the eldest hight Guales, or Gualea.
These daughters he sent to Alba Syluius, which was the eleuenth king of Italie, or the sixt
king of the Latines, to the end they might be married to his noble men of the bloud of
Troians, because the Sabines refused to ioine their daughters with them in marriage. Furthermore,
he was the first prince of his land that euer inuaded France after Brute, and is
commended as author and originall builder of many cities, both in his owne kingdome, and
else where. His sonnes also vnder the conduct of Assaracus, one of their eldest brethren,
returning out of Italie, after they had conducted their sisters thither, inuaded Germanie,
being first molested by the people of that countrie in their rage, and by the helpe of the
said Alba subdued a great part of that countrie, &amp; there planted themselues. Our histories
say, that Ebracus their father married them in their returne, and aided them in their conquests,
<span class="rightnote">
The citie of Caerbranke builded. <i>Matth. West.</i></span>
and that he builded the citie of Caerbranke, now called Yorke, about the 14, yeare
of his reigne. He builded also in Albania now called Scotland, the castle of Maidens,
afterward called Edenburgh of Adian one of their kings. The citie of Alclud was builded
likewise by him (as some write) now decaied. After which cities thus builded, he sailed
<span class="leftnote">
Fortie yeares hath <i>Math. West.</i> and <i>Gal. Monuine.</i></span>
ouer into Gallia, now called France, with a great armie, and subduing the Galles as is
aforesaid, he returned home with great riches and triumph. Now when he had guided the land
of Britaine in noble wise by the tearme of fortie yeares, he died, and was buried at Yorke.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
BRUTE GREENESHIELD THE SIXT RULER. <i>Iacobus Lef.</i></span>
Brute Greeneshield, the sonne of Ebranke, was made gouernor of this land in the yeare
of the world 3009, Asa reigning in Iuda, and Baasa in Israell. This prince bare alwaies
in the field a gréene shield, whereof he tooke his surname, and of him some forraine authors
affirme, that he made an attempt to bring the whole realme of France vnder his subiection,
which he performed, because his father susteined some dishonor and losse in his last voiage
into that countrie. Howbeit they say, that when he came into Henaud, Brinchild a prince
of that quarter gaue him also a great ouerthrow, and compelled him to retire home againe
into his countrie. This I borrow out of William Harison, who in his chronologie toucheth
the same at large, concluding in the end, that the said passage of this prince into France is
verie likelie to be true, and that he named a parcell of Armorica lieng on the south, and in
manner vpon the verie loine after his owne name, and also a citie which he builded there Britaine.
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Strabo lib. 4.</i></span>
For (saith he) it should séeme by Strabo. lib. 4. that there was a noble citie of that name
long before his time in the said countrie, whereof Plinie also speaketh lib. 4. cap. 7. albeit
that he ascribe it vnto France after a disordered maner. More I find not of this foresaid
Brute, sauing that he ruled the land a certeine time, his father yet liuing, and after his decease<a name="page446" id="page446"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;446]</span>
the tearme of twelue yeares, and then died, and was buried at Caerbranke now called Yorke.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
LEILL THE SEVENTH RULER.</span>
Carleil builded.
Chester repaired.
Leill the sonne of Brute Greeneshield, began to reigne in the yeare of the world 3021,
the same time that Asa was reigning in Iuda, and Ambri in Israell. He built the citie now
called Carleil, which then after his owne name was called Caerleil, that is, Leill his citie,
or the citie of Leill. He repaired also (as Henrie Bradshaw saith) the citie of Caerleon
now called Chester, which (as in the same Bradshaw appeareth) was built before Brutus
entrie into this land by a giant named Leon Gauer. But what authoritie he had to auouch
this, it may be doubted, for Ranulfe Higden in his woorke intituled "Polychronicon," saith
in plaine wordes, that it is vnknowen who was the first founder of Chester, but that it tooke
the name of the soiourning there of some Romaine legions, by whome also it is not vnlike
that it might be first built by P. Ostorius Scapula, who as we find, after he had subdued
Caratacus king of the Ordouices that inhabited the countries now called Lancashire, Cheshire,
and Salopshire, built in those parts, and among the Silures, certeine places of defense, for
the better harbrough of his men of warre, and kéeping downe of such Britaines as were
still readie to moue rebellion.</p>
<p>
But now to the purpose concerning K. Leill. We find it recorded that he was in the
beginning of his reigne verie vpright, and desirous to sée iustice executed, and aboue all
thinges loued peace &amp; quietnesse; but as yeares increased with him, so his vertues began
to diminish, in so much that abandoning the care for the bodie of the commonwealth, he
suffered his owne bodie to welter in all vice and voluptuousnesse, and so procuring the
hatred of his subiects, caused malice and discord to rise amongst them, which during his
life he was neuer able to appease. But leauing them so at variance, he departed this life,
&amp; was buried at Carleil, which as ye haue heard he had builded while he liued.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
LUD or LUDHURDIBRAS THE EIGHT RULER.</span>
Kaerkin or Canterburie is builded. Caerguent is builded. Paladour is builded.
Lud or Ludhurdibras the sonne of Leill began to gouerne in the yeare of the world 3046.
In the beginning of his reigne, hée sought to appease the debate that was raised in his
fathers daies, and bring the realme to hir former quietnesse, and after that he had brought
it to good end, he buiided the towne of Kaerkin now called Canterburie: also the towne of
Caerguent now cleped Winchester, and mount Paladour now called Shaftsburie. About
the building of which towne of Shaftsburie, Aquila a prophet of the British nation wrote
his prophesies, of which some fragments remaine yet to be scene, translated into the Latine
by some ancient writers. When this Lud had reigned 29 yeares, he died, and left a
sonne behind him named Baldud.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
BALDUD OR BLADUD THE NINTH RULER.
<i>Gal. Mon.</i> The king was learned. Hot bathes.</span>
Baldud the sonne of Ludhurdibras began to rule ouer the Britaines in the yeare of the
world 3085. This man was well séene in the sciences of astronomie and nigromancie, by
which (as the common report saith) he made the hot bathes in the citie of Caerbran now
called Bath. But William of Malmesburie is of a contrarie opinion, affirming that Iulius
Cesar made those bathes, or rather repaired them when he was here in England: which is
not like to be true: for Iulius Cesar, as by good coniecture we haue to thinke, neuer came
so farre within the land that way forward. But of these bathes more shall be said in the
description. Now to procéed.
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Mat. West.</i> The prince did flie.</span>
This Baldud tooke such pleasure in artificiall practises &amp;
magike, that he taught this art throughout all his realme. And to shew his cunning in
other points, vpon a presumptuous pleasure which he had therein, he tooke vpon him to
flie in the aire, but he fell vpon the temple of Apollo, which stood in the citie of Troinouant,
and there was torne in péeces after he had ruled the Britaines by the space of 20 yeares.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
LEIR THE 10. RULER. <i>Mat. West.</i> Leicester is builded.</span>
Leir the sonne of Baldud was admitted ruler ouer the Britaines, in the yeare of the
world 3105, at what time Ioas reigned in Iuda. This Leir was a prince of right noble demeanor,
gouerning his land and subiects in great wealth. He made the towne of Caerleir
now called Leicester, which standeth vpon the riuer of Sore. It is written that he had by<a name="page447" id="page447"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;447]</span>
his wife three daughters without other issue, whose names were Gonorilla, Regan, and Cordeilla,
which daughters he greatly loued, but specially Cordeilla the yoongest farre aboue
the two elder. When this Leir therefore was come to great yeres, &amp; began to waxe vnweldie
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Gal. Mon.</i></span>
through age, he thought to vnderstand the affections of his daughters towards him,
and preferre hir whome he best loued, to the succession ouer the kingdome. Whervpon
he first asked Gonorilla the eldest, how well she loued him: who calling hir gods to record,
<span class="rightnote">
A triall of loue.</span>
protested that she "loued him more than hir owne life, which by right and reason
should be most déere vnto hir. With which answer the father being well pleased, turned
to the second, and demanded of hir how well she loued him: who answered (confirming
hir saiengs with great othes) that she loued him more than toong could expresse, and farre
aboue all other creatures of the world."</p>
<p>
Then called he his yoongest daughter Cordeilla before him, and asked of hir what account
she made of him, vnto whome she made this answer as followeth: "Knowing the great
<span class="rightnote">
The answer of the yoongest daughter.</span>
loue and fatherlie zeale that you haue alwaies borne towards me (for the which I maie not
answere you otherwise than I thinke, and as my conscience leadeth me) I protest vnto you,
that I haue loued you euer, and will continuallie (while I liue) loue you as my naturall
father. And if you would more vnderstand of the loue that I beare you, assertaine your
selfe, that so much as you haue, so much you are woorth, and so much I loue you, and no
more. The father being nothing content with this answer, married his two eldest daughters,
<span class="rightnote">
The two eldest daughters are maried. The realme is promised to his two daughters.</span>
the one vnto Henninus the duke of Cornewall, and the other vnto Maglanus the duke of
Albania, betwixt whome he willed and ordeined that his land should be diuided after his
death, and the one halfe thereof immediatlie should be assigned to them in hand: but for
the third daughter Cordeilla he reserued nothing."</p>
<p>
Neuertheles it fortuned that one of the princes of Gallia (which now is called France)
whose name was Aganippus, hearing of the beautie, womanhood, and good conditions of
the said Cordeilla, desired to haue hir in mariage, and sent ouer to hir father, requiring that
he might haue hir to wife: to whome answer was made, that he might haue his daughter,
but as for anie dower he could haue none, for all was promised and assured to hir other
sisters alreadie. Aganippus notwithstanding this answer of deniall to receiue anie thing by
way of dower with Cordeilla, tooke hir to wife, onlie moued thereto (I saie) for respect of
hir person and amiable vertues. This Aganippus was one of the twelue kings that ruled
Gallia in those daies, as in the British historie it is recorded. But to proceed.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
He gouerned the third part of Gallia as <i>Gal. Mon.</i> saith.</span>
After that Leir was fallen into age, the two dukes that had married his two eldest daughters,
thinking it long yer the gouernment of the land did come to their hands, arose against
him in armour, and reft from him the gouernance of the land, vpon conditions to be continued
for terme of life: by the which he was put to his portion, that is, to liue after a
rate assigned to him for the maintenance of his estate, which in processe of time was diminished
as well by Maglanus as by Henninus. But the greatest griefe that Leir tooke, was
to see the vnkindnesse of his daughters, which seemed to thinke that all was too much
which their father had, the same being neuer so little: in so much that going from the one
to the other, he was brought to that miserie, that scarslie they would allow him one seruant
to wait vpon him.</p>
<p>
In the end, such was the vnkindnesse, or (as I maie saie) the vnnaturalnesse which he
found in his two daughters, notwithstanding their faire and pleasant words vttered in time
past, that being constreined of necessitie, he fled the land, &amp; sailed into Gallia, there to
seeke some comfort of his yongest daughter Cordeilla, whom before time he hated. The
ladie Cordeilla hearing that he was arriued in poore estate, she first sent to him priuilie a
certeine summe of monie to apparell himselfe withall, and to reteine a certeine number of
seruants that might attend vpon him in honorable wise, as apperteined to the estate which
he had borne: and then so accompanied, she appointed him to come to the court, which
he did, and was so ioifullie, honorablie, and louinglie receiued, both by his sonne in law
Aganippus, and also by his daughter Cordeilla, that his hart was greatlie comforted: for he
was no lesse honored, than if he had beene king of the whole countrie himselfe.</p>
<p>
Now when he had informed his sonne in law and his daughter in what sort he had béene<a name="page448" id="page448"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;448]</span>
vsed by his other daughters, Aganippus caused a mightie armie to be put in a readinesse,
and likewise a great nauie of ships to be rigged, to passe ouer into Britaine with Leir his
father in law, to sée him againe restored to his kingdome. It was accorded, that Cordeilla
should also go with him to take possession of the land, the which he promised to leaue vnto
hir, as the rightfull inheritour after his decesse, notwithstanding any former grant made to
hir sisters or to their husbands in anie maner of wise.</p>
<p>
Herevpon, when this armie and nauie of ships were readie, Leir and his daughter Cordeilla
with hir husband tooke the sea, and arriuing in Britaine, fought with their enimies,
and discomfited them in battell, in the which Maglanus and Henninus were slaine: and then
was Leir restored to his kingdome, which he ruled after this by the space of two yéeres,
<span class="rightnote">

and then died, fortie yeeres after he first began to reigne. His bodie was buried at Leicester

<h3>THE SIXT CHAPTER.</h3>
<p><span class="rightnote">
QUEENE CORDEILLA</span>
Cordeilla the yoongest daughter of Leir was admitted Q. and supreme gouernesse of
Britaine, in the yéere of the world 3155, before the bylding of Rome 54, Vzia then reigning
in Iuda, and Ieroboam ouer Israell. This Cordeilla after hir fathers deceasse ruled the
land of Britaine right worthilie during the space of fiue yéeres, in which meane time hir
husband died, and then about the end of those fiue yéeres, hir two nephewes Margan and
Cunedag, sonnes to hir aforesaid sisters, disdaining to be vnder the gouernment of a woman,
leuied warre against hir, and destroied a great part of the land, and finallie tooke hir prisoner,
and laid hir fast in ward, wherewith she tooke such griefe, being a woman of a
manlie courage, and despairing to recouer libertie, there she slue hirselfe, when she had
reigned (as before is mentioned) the tearme of fiue yéeres.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
CUNEDAG AND MARGAN.</span>
Cunedagius and Marganus nephewes to Cordeilla, hauing recouered the land out of hir
hands, diuided the same betwixt them, that is to saie, the countrie ouer and beyond Humber
fell to Margan, as it stretcheth euen to Catnesse, and the other part lieng south and by-west,
was assigned to Cunedagius. This partition chanced in the yéere of the world 3170,
before the building of Rome 47, Uzia as then reigning in Iuda, and Ieroboam in Israell.
Afterwards, these two cousins, Cunedag and Margan, had not reigned thus past a two yéeres,
but thorough some seditious persons, Margan was persuaded to raise warre against Cunedag,
telling him in his eare, how it was a shame for him being come of the elder sister, not to
haue the rule of the whole Ile in his hand. Herevpon ouercome with pride, ambition, and
<span class="rightnote">
Margan inuadeth his cousine Cunedag.</span>
couetousnesse, he raised an armie, and entring into the land of Cunedag, he burned and destroied
the countrie before him in miserable maner.</p>
<p>
Cunedag in all hast to resist his aduersarie, assembled also all the power he could make,
and comming with the same against Margan, gaue him battell, in the which he slue a great
number of Margans people, and put the residue to flight, and furthermore pursued him
from countrie to countrie, till he came into Cambria, now called Wales, where the said
Margan gaue him eftsoones a new battell: but being too weake in number of men, he was
there ouercome and slaine in the field, by reason whereof that countrie tooke name of him,
<span class="rightnote">
Margan is slaine. <i>Matt. West.</i></span>

English toong, Margans land. This was the end of that Margan, after he had reigned
with his brother two yéeres, or thereabouts.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
CUNEDAGUS ALONE.</span>
After the death of Margan, Cunedag the sonne of Hennius and Ragaie (middlemost
daughter of Leir before mentioned) became ruler of all the whole land of Britaine, in the
yeare of the world 3172, before the building of Rome 45, Vzia still reigning in Iuda,<a name="page449" id="page449"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;449]</span>
and Ieroboam in Israell. He gouerned this Ile well and honourablie for the tearme of 33
yeares, and then dieng, his bodie was buried at Troinouant or London. Moreouer, our
writers doo report, that he builded thrée temples, one to Mars at Perth in Scotland, another
to Mercurie at Bangor, and the third to Apollo in Cornewall.</p>

of the accidents coincident with their times</i>.</p>


<h3>THE SEUENTH CHAPTER.</h3>

<p><span class="rightnote">
RIUALLUS THE I3. RULER.</span>
Riuallus, the sonne of Cunedag, began to reigne ouer the Britaines in the yeare of
the world 3203, before the building of Rome 15, Ioathan as then being king of Iuda,
and Phacea king of Israel. This Riuall gouerned the Iland in great welth and prosperitie.
In his time it rained bloud by the space of thrée daies togither; after which raine ensued
<span class="leftnote">
It rained blood. <i>Matth. West.</i></span>
such an excéeding number and multitude of flies, so noisome and contagious, that much
people died by reason thereof. When he had reigned 46 yeares he died, and was buried
<span class="rightnote">
Rome builded.</span>
at Caerbranke now called Yorke. In the time of this Riuals reigne was the citie of Rome
builded, after concordance of most part of writers. Perdix also a wizard, and a learned
astrologian florished and writ his prophesies, and Herene also.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
GURGUSTIUS THE 14. RULER.</span>
Gurgustius, the son of the before named Riuall, began to gouerne the Britaines in the
yeare after the creation of the world 3249, and after the first foundation of Rome 33,
Ezechias reigning in Iuda. This Gurgustius in the chronicle of England, is called Gorbodian
the sonne of Reignold, he reigned 37 yeares, then departing this life, was buried at
Caerbranke (now called Yorke) by his father.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
SYSILLIUS THE 15. RULER.</span>
Sysillius, or after some writers SYLUIUS, the brother of Gurgustius, was chosen to haue
the gouernance of Britaine, in the yere of the world 3287, and after the building of Rome 71,
Manasses still reigning in Iuda. This Sysillius in the English chronicle is named Secill.
He reigned 49 yeares, and then died, and was buried at Carbadon, now called Bath.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
JAGO THE 16. RULER.</span>
Iago or Lago, the cousin of Gurgustius, as next inheritor to Sysillius, tooke vpon him
the gouernement of Britaine, in the yeare of the world 3386, and after the building of
Rome 120, in whose time the citie of Ierusalem was taken by Nabuchodonozar and the king
of Iuda, Mathania, otherwise called Zedechias, being slaine. This Iago or Lago died without
issue, when he had reigned 28 yeares, and was buried at Yorke.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
KINIMACUS THE 17. RULER.</span>
Kinimacus or Kinmarus the sonne of Sysillius as some write, or rather the brother of Iago,
began to gouerne the land of Britain, in the yere of the world 3364, and after the building
of Rome 148, the Iewes as then being in the third yeare of their captiuitie of Babylon.
This Kinimacus departed this life, after he had reigned 54 yeares, and was buried at Yorke.</p>

<h3>THE EIGHT CHAPTER.</h3>

<p><span class="rightnote">
GORBODUG THE 18. RULER.</span>
Gorbodug the sonne of Kinimacus began his reigne ouer the Britains, in the yeare
after the creation of the world 3418, from the building of the citie of Rome 202, the 58 of
the Iews captiuitie at Babylon. This Gorbodug by most likelihood to bring histories to<a name="page450" id="page450"></a><span class="page">[Page&nbsp;450]</span>
accord, should reigne about the tearme of 62 yeares, and then departing this world, was
buried at London, leauing after him two sonnes Ferrex and Porrex, or after some writers,
Ferreus and Porreus.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
FERREX THE 19. RULER</span>
Ferrex with Porrex his brother began iointlie to rule ouer the Britaines, in the yeare of
the world 3476, after the building of Rome 260, at which time, the people of Rome forsooke
their citie in their rebellious mood. These two brethren continued for a time in good
friendship and amitie, till at length through couetousnesse, and desire of greater dominion,
prouoked by flatterers, they fell at variance and discord, wherby Ferrex was constreined to
<span class="rightnote">
Ferrex fled into Gallia.</span>
flée into Gallia, and there purchased aid of a great duke called Gunhardus or Suardus, and
so returned into Britaine, thinking to preuaile and obteine the dominion of the whole Iland.
But his brother Porrex was readie to receiue him with battell after he was landed, in the
which battell Ferrex was slaine, with the more part of his people. The English chronicle
saith, that Porrex was he that fled into France, &amp; at his returne, was slaine, and that Ferrex
suruiued. But Geffrey of Monmouth &amp; Polychronicon are of a contrarie opinion. Matthew
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Matth. West.</i></span>
Westmonasteriensis writeth, that Porrex deuising waies to kill Ferrex, atchiued his purpose
and slue him. But whether of them so euer suruiued, the mother of them was so highlie
offended for the death of him that was slaine, whom she most intierlie loued, that setting
apart all motherlie affection, she found the meanes to enter the chamber of him that suruiued
<span class="rightnote">
The mother killeth hir son.</span>
in the night season, and as he slept, she with the helpe of hir maidens slue him, and
cut him into small péeces, as the writers doo affirme. Such was the end of these two
brethren, after they had reigned by the space of foure or fiue yeares.</p>
<p>
After this followed a troublous season, full of cruell warre, and seditious discord, whereby
in the end, and for the space of fiftie yeares, the monarchie or sole gouernement of the
Lland became a pentarchie, that is, it was diuided betwixt fiue kings or rulers, till Dunwallon
of Cornewall ouercame them all. Thus the line of Brute (according to the report of most
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Robert Record.</i></span>
writers) tooke an end: for after the death of the two foresaid brethren, no rightfull inheritor
was left aliue to succéed them in the kingdome. The names of these fiue kings are
found in certeine old pedegrées: and although the same be much corrupted in diuers
copies, yet these vndernamed are the most agréeable.</p>
<p>
But of these fiue kings or dukes, the English chronicle alloweth Cloton king of Cornewall
for most rightfull heire. There appeareth not any time certeine by report of ancient
<span class="rightnote">
<i>Fabian.</i> Ciuill warres 51. yeares.</span>
authors, how long this variance continued amongst the Britains:
but (as some say) it lasted for the space of 51 yeres, coniecturing so much by that
which is recorded in Polychron, who saith, who it endured euen till the beginning of
the reigne of Mulmucius Dunwallon, who began to gouerne from the time that Brute first
<span class="rightnote">
(sic.)</span>
entred Britaine, about the space of 703 thrée yeares.</p>
<p>
¶ Here ye must note, that there is difference amongst writers about the supputation and
account of these yeares, insomuch that some making their reckoning after certeine writers,
and finding the same to varie aboue thrée C. yeares, are brought into further doubt of the
truth of the whole historie: but whereas other haue by diligent search tried out the continuance
of euerie gouernors reigne, and reduced the same to a likelihood of some conformitie,
I haue thought best to follow the same, leauing the credit thereof with the first authors.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
